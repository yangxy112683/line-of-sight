# Line of Sight — Technical Architecture (v1)

Status: FINAL for v1, except items marked **[VERIFY IN M0]** — those are
assumptions the M0 spikes must confirm; if a spike contradicts one, update this
doc and record the finding in `docs/SPIKE_NOTES.md`.

```

One daemon process serves everything. No proxying of the agent's traffic, no
hooks required (pure file-tailing keeps us fail-open and version-independent).

## 2. Tech stack (decided — do not substitute)

- **Language**: TypeScript (strict), Node.js ≥ 20. Single npm package,
  workspaces optional but not required.
- **Daemon/HTTP**: Fastify. Live updates via **SSE** (simpler than WebSocket;
  we only push server→client).
- **Store**: `better-sqlite3`, single DB file `~/.sight/sight.db`, WAL
  mode. Full-text search via **FTS5 with the `trigram` tokenizer** (built into
  the SQLite bundled by better-sqlite3; trigram handles CJK + substring
  matching without a segmenter). **[VERIFIED M0]** trigram available
  (SQLite 3.53.4), but queries < 3 chars match nothing — use `LIKE '%q%'` on
  `messages.text_content` for queries shorter than 3 characters.
- **File watching**: `chokidar` on the transcript root dirs.
- **Frontend**: Vite + React + TypeScript. Styling: plain CSS modules or
  Tailwind — implementer's choice, but no heavy UI framework. Markdown
  rendering: `react-markdown` + `rehype-highlight` (code highlighting).
  Sanitize rendered HTML (transcripts contain untrusted content —
  agent/webpage text must not become live HTML/scripts).
- **CLI**: hand-rolled dispatch, no arg-parsing library (wrapper passthrough safety + startup
  latency; decided 2026-08-24).
  Distributed as an npm bin (`npm link` during development).
  Note: publish as npm package `line-of-sight` (name verified available
  2026-08-19) with `"bin": {"sight": ...}`. The npm package `sight` itself is
  taken by a stale 2022 lib — irrelevant, since only the bin name is `sight`.
  GitHub home: the `getlineofsight` org (registered 2026-08); target repo
  `getlineofsight/line-of-sight`. Domain not registered yet (deferred until
  public release; first choice `lineofsight.dev`).
- **Tests**: `vitest`.

## 4. Ingestion: the Adapter interface

```ts
// src/adapters/types.ts
export interface AgentAdapter {
  id: 'claude-code' | 'codex';           // extend by union, no registry magic
  /** Absolute dirs to scan/watch for transcripts. */
  roots(): string[];
  /** chokidar depth under each root; omit = unlimited. */
  watchDepth?: number;
  /** Cheap check: is this file a session transcript this adapter owns? */
  matches(filePath: string): boolean;
  /** Parse one jsonl line into zero or more normalized events. MUST NOT throw. */
  parseLine(line: string, ctx: { filePath: string; byteOffset: number }): NormalizedEvent[];
  /** Derive session metadata from path + first events. */
  sessionMeta(filePath: string, firstEvents: NormalizedEvent[]): SessionMeta;
  /** sessionId → what the agent process is doing right now ('busy' mid-turn,
   *  'waiting' parked on the user, 'alive' = process exists but the agent
   *  has no busy/idle vocabulary — the transcript's turn markers decide;
   *  since = when that state began, 0 if unknown), if the agent exposes
   *  such a signal. MUST NOT throw; empty map when unavailable. */
  liveSessions?(): Map<string, { state: 'busy' | 'waiting' | 'alive'; since: number }>;
}

Session ids must be globally unique across adapters (all adapters share one
sessions table and one merged live map) — derive them from the transcript's
own uuid.
```

### Normalized model (shared/types.ts)

```ts
export interface SessionMeta {
  id: string;              // adapter-scoped stable id (claude: session uuid from filename)
  adapter: 'claude-code' | 'codex';
  filePath: string;
  projectDir: string | null;
  title: string;           // custom-title > ai-title > first user prompt, truncated to 120 chars
  startedAt: number; updatedAt: number;
  messageCount: number;
}

export type NormalizedEvent =
  | { kind: 'message'; id: string; role: 'user' | 'assistant';
      ts: number; blocks: RenderBlock[]; sessionPatch?: SessionPatch }
  | { kind: 'meta'; id: string; ts: number; label: string; raw: unknown;
      sessionPatch?: SessionPatch }                                        // system/attachment entries
  | { kind: 'unknown'; id: string; ts: number; raw: unknown };             // defensive fallback

// Session metadata revealed mid-file (titles, cwd); applied by ingest with
// title precedence custom > ai > prompt (decided 2026-08-24).
export interface SessionPatch {
  projectDir?: string;
  title?: string;
  titleSource?: 'custom' | 'ai' | 'prompt';
}

export type RenderBlock =
  | { type: 'text'; markdown: string }
  | { type: 'thinking'; text: string }
  | { type: 'tool_use'; id?: string | null; toolName: string; summary: string; input: unknown }
  | { type: 'tool_result'; toolUseId: string | null; summary: string;
      output: string; isError: boolean }
  | { type: 'raw'; json: unknown };   // anything unrecognized inside a message
```

Notes:
- `id` must be stable across re-parses (use the transcript's own uuid when
  present; Codex fallback = `sessionUuid:byteOffset`, independent of rollout
  location; Claude keeps its path-based fallback). Q&A anchors reference message ids.
- `summary` for tool blocks is computed at parse time (e.g. `Read src/x.ts`,
  `Bash: npm test`). Keep heuristics per-adapter, simple, and safe on missing
  fields.

### Claude Code adapter specifics **[VERIFIED M0 — details in SPIKE_NOTES.md]**

- Transcript root: `~/.claude/projects/`. One subdirectory per project cwd
  (path munged **lossily**: `/` and `_` both → `-`; derive projectDir from
  the `cwd` field on message lines, never from the dir name), containing
  `<session-uuid>.jsonl` files. `matches()` accepts those plus subagent
  transcripts at `<uuid>/subagents/agent-*.jsonl`, ingested as child sessions
  of the surrounding `<uuid>` (see "Subagent sessions" below); `memory/*.md`
  and the `.meta.json` sidecars are not transcripts.
- Line schema (observed on CLI 2.1.202–2.1.241; treat as unstable): JSON
  objects with `type` — observed: `user`, `assistant`, `system`, `attachment`,
  `mode`, `permission-mode`, `last-prompt`, `ai-title`, `custom-title`,
  `agent-name`, `bridge-session`, `queue-operation`, `file-history-snapshot`,
  `file-history-delta`, `atis-latch` (no `summary` seen) — plus `uuid`,
  `parentUuid`, `timestamp` (ISO ms Z), `sessionId`, `cwd`, and on message
  lines `message` (Messages-API-shaped; `content` is a **string or** array of
  blocks — `text`, `tool_use`, `tool_result`, `thinking`, `image`,
  `fallback`, ...). `tool_result.content` is itself string or array. Tool
  results arrive as `type: "user"` entries whose content is `tool_result`
  blocks — render those as part of the tool flow, not as user prompts.
  Non-message types are small — render as `meta`. `custom-title`/`ai-title`
  feed the session title (see SPEC 5.2).
- Top-level lines never had `isSidechain: true` (subagents live in the
  subagents dir); keep the defensive `meta` rendering if one ever appears.
- Fixtures from real (redacted) lines: `test/fixtures/claude-code/`.

### Subagent sessions

A subagent run is an ordinary session with two extra columns: `parent_id` (the
surrounding `<uuid>` dir — derived from the path, so always known) and
`tool_use_id` (from the sibling `agent-*.meta.json`, which also supplies the
title `agentType · description`; best-effort, the file is undocumented). Line
schema is identical to a top-level transcript, so `parseLine` is unchanged;
only `fork-context-ref` is new (dropped as bookkeeping). Workflow-tool runs
put their agents one level down, `subagents/workflows/<wf_id>/agent-*.jsonl`,
beside a `journal.jsonl` ledger (skipped); their meta.json has no
`toolUseId`, so they title as `workflow-subagent · <wf_id>` and have no row
link (decided 2026-08-28).

`listSessions()` returns `parent_id IS NULL` only — children are reached from
their parent, never from the session list. `/api/sessions/:id` carries
`children`, and the viewer keys them by `tool_use_id` to put a "transcript ↗"
link on the Task row. Two link sites, because the CLI writes Task calls two
ways: on the `tool_use` fold when the use reached the transcript, and on the
orphan `tool_result` when it did not (parallel Task batches write only
results). A child with no `meta.json` has no `tool_use_id` and gets no row
link — the header's "Subagents · N" popover is the fallback route.

No process signal of its own: subagents have no `~/.claude/sessions/
<pid>.json`. Their end is read from the parent transcript instead — the
`<task-notification>` line (async Agent/Task and Workflow calls; the
tool_result is only a spawn-ack) or a sync Task's tool_result — and stored
as `ended_at`; a child without one is running while its parent process is
(decided 2026-08-28).

### Ingestion pipeline

Codex child rollouts use the same parent/children UI. Their own `session_meta`
header supplies `parent_thread_id`, with the nested
`source.subagent.thread_spawn.parent_thread_id` as a fallback;
`forked_from_id` alone does not establish a child relationship. The agent
nickname/path names a worker, and guardian review sessions with explicit
parentage are children too. Copied parent headers in forked context are
ignored. Codex children use their own writer lock and turn markers for
liveness, rather than inheriting Claude's parent process rule. Nested children
are reached through their immediate parent; parent deletion removes all
descendants. A one-time Codex-only checkpoint invalidation backfills existing
rows without removing messages or side chats, and invalidates compressed
fingerprints so their staged metadata is replayed.

1. On daemon start: scan all adapter roots; for each transcript file, if
   `(filePath, size, mtime)` differs from the stored checkpoint, incrementally
   parse from the stored byte offset (files are append-only; if size shrank,
   re-parse from 0).
2. chokidar watches roots; on change, same incremental parse; new events go to
   (a) SQLite (messages + FTS) and (b) the SSE hub for live viewers.
3. Parsing must be line-buffered and tolerant of a partial last line (the
   checkpoint stays at the last complete newline; the tail is re-read once the
   newline arrives).

Codex rollouts also live in the flat `~/.codex/archived_sessions/` directory.
Scan active then archived rollouts before replaying `session_index.jsonl`;
watch Codex locations through their parent with a scoped directory filter,
even when initially absent; rescan once the subscription is ready.
Archive/unarchive are file
moves, separate from compression. Codex's optional adapter source resolver
keeps an existing bound UUID source, otherwise chooses an active source before
an archived one, using an ordered discovery snapshot refreshed for new paths
and missing bindings. Missing-path ingestion and startup pruning resolve surviving
UUID sources before deletion; unreadable directories are errors, not absence.
Binding a Codex source updates the stored path and migrates legacy fallback
anchors in a transaction. `kv` stores `codex-source:<uuid>` = device/inode:
rename preserves the checkpoint across restarts; a copied/replaced source is
reparsed while retaining titles and side chats. Final deletion clears this
fact. Ask awaits Codex reconciliation and refreshes its source and anchor
after responder availability probing. Claude ingestion and deletion do not
use source reconciliation.
Codex accepts `.jsonl.zst` in either location. A restored plain sibling
wins even while a compressed sibling remains bound. Compressed physical
fingerprints include representation/dev/inode/size/mtimeNs/ctimeNs; decoded
UTF-8 byte positions are the checkpoints and fallback-ID coordinates.
An unchanged valid source is skipped; a changed fingerprint triggers replay
from frame start. Before publishing, revalidate the open source and selected
path. No compressed-size comparison or compressed seek uses decoded offsets.

The optional `zstd-napi` low-level decoder loads only on compressed reads.
It runs inline (native decode is far cheaper than the per-batch JSON parse
that follows it) and limits history to 8 MiB, input slices to 4 KiB, output slices to
128 KiB, records to 8 MiB, and in-flight batches to 256 records / roughly
512 KiB (a single larger record is still bounded by the record limit).
The daemon yields between parse/database batches. SQLite's anonymous attached
temporary database holds normalized replay rows with a 2 MiB page-cache
budget; it has no raw JSONL copy or user-owned data. Complete frame and
JSONL-tail validation precedes atomic replacement of the main derived rows.
Detach/connection close/process death removes staging. Side chats, frozen
snapshots, and title precedence survive replacement. Corruption keeps the
previous derived view, adds a passive source diagnostic, and blocks Ask;
new corrupt sources expose an error with no partial messages. Failures are
cached per physical fingerprint to bound repeated decoding/logging, and heal
on valid source change. Deletion clears source/fingerprint/error facts and
honors the existing `keepSideChats` preference. Manual compressed reingestion
invalidates fingerprints without deleting the last valid derived view.

This adds no archive controls, runtime downloads, or Sight-owned retention.

## 5. Store (SQLite)

```sql
CREATE TABLE sessions (
  id TEXT PRIMARY KEY, adapter TEXT, file_path TEXT UNIQUE, project_dir TEXT,
  title TEXT DEFAULT '', title_source TEXT,   -- prompt | ai | custom; higher wins
  started_at INTEGER, updated_at INTEGER,
  message_count INTEGER DEFAULT 0,            -- user + assistant rows, recounted per append
  byte_offset INTEGER DEFAULT 0,  -- always at a line boundary; partial tails re-read
  parent_id TEXT, tool_use_id TEXT, workflow_id TEXT, ended_at INTEGER,  -- subagent runs (§4)
  turn_open INTEGER, turn_started_at INTEGER  -- agents with turn markers; NULL otherwise
);
CREATE TABLE messages (
  id TEXT, session_id TEXT, seq INTEGER,
  role TEXT,                      -- user | assistant | meta | unknown
  ts INTEGER,
  blocks_json TEXT,               -- serialized RenderBlock[] (meta: {label, raw}; unknown: raw)
  text_content TEXT,              -- search text: dialog only, markdown stripped
  parent_id TEXT,                 -- transcript tree; a fork marks the abandoned branch
  PRIMARY KEY (session_id, id)
);
CREATE VIRTUAL TABLE messages_fts USING fts5(
  text_content, content='messages', tokenize='trigram'
);  -- external content; AFTER INSERT/UPDATE/DELETE triggers on messages keep it in sync
CREATE TABLE side_chats (
  id TEXT PRIMARY KEY, session_id TEXT, anchor_message_id TEXT,
  anchor_text TEXT, created_at INTEGER,
  turns_json TEXT,                -- [{role:'user'|'assistant', text, ts}]
  excerpt_json TEXT               -- AskSnapshot: the excerpt rows frozen at creation (store.ts)
);
CREATE TABLE stats (day TEXT, event TEXT, count INTEGER, PRIMARY KEY (day, event));
CREATE TABLE kv (key TEXT PRIMARY KEY, value TEXT);  -- e.g. last_viewer_open
```

- Only the daemon opens the DB through `Store`. Anything else (`sight stats`)
  opens it read-only: the constructor's rebuild must never run underneath a
  running daemon.
- The DB is derived data **except** `side_chats`, `stats` and `kv` (user-owned;
  a rebuild never wipes them). A side chat leaves only with its session —
  unless `keepSideChats` (config), the single opt-in exception to B9.
- Sessions mirror the disk (SPEC B9): when a transcript file disappears, the
  ingester deletes its session — subagent children, side chats and the
  parent-recorded facts in `kv` — on the watcher's `unlink`, and by a prune
  after the start-up scan. `sessions`, `messages` and the FTS index are dropped and
  rebuilt from the transcripts whenever `SCHEMA_VERSION` changes (tracked in
  `PRAGMA user_version`): an upgrade's first daemon start re-runs the initial
  scan — seconds per hundred MB of transcripts. No column-level migrations
  on derived tables; the user-owned ones take additive columns, checked with
  `PRAGMA table_info` on open.

## 6. Responder (the answering engine)

Ask strictly matches the viewed session: Claude Code sessions use claude-cli,
Codex sessions use codex-cli. If that CLI is unavailable, show a setup hint
and return 409; never use the other engine. Legacy global `responder` pins
are ignored without editing config. Model/effort settings remain per engine.
This routing decision was adopted 2026-09-13; Adapter and Responder remain
separate seams, but cross-engine answering is not a product capability.

```ts
export interface Responder {
  id: 'claude-cli' | 'codex-cli';
  available(): Promise<boolean>;        // e.g. `which claude`
  /** Streamed answer. MUST be read-only (see per-engine notes).
   *  onStatus: optional tool-activity progress for the panel. */
  answer(req: ResponderRequest, onChunk: (s: string) => void,
         signal: AbortSignal, onStatus?: (s: string) => void): Promise<string>;
}

export interface ResponderRequest {
  question: string;
  anchorText: string;
  sessionFilePath: string;   // pointer — engine reads it itself when it has tools
  projectDir: string | null;
  priorTurns: { role: 'user' | 'assistant'; text: string }[];
  branches?: { anchorAbandoned: boolean } | null;  // rewind branches exist; which side the anchor is on
  excerpt?: string;  // anchor-centered clean excerpt (store-built) — spares the locate/orient tool rounds;
                     // rows carry their timestamp (a Grep coordinate into the file), tool output is cut to its head;
                     // frozen when the side chat is created and reused by every follow-up (side_chats.excerpt_json)
}
```

**Resolution** (`responders/index.ts`): `candidates()` returns only the
engine matching a known session adapter. `resolveResponder()` probes only
that engine. Unknown/missing adapters have no candidate.

`GET /api/responder/status?adapter=...` reports the session's available engine
or a specific setup message. The same routing is used by prewarming and Ask;
the engine is announced in the first Ask SSE frame.

### claude-cli responder **[VERIFIED M0]**

Spawn per question (cwd = projectDir if available, else the transcript's
directory):

```
claude -p "<composed prompt>" --allowedTools "Read,Grep,Glob" \
  --disallowedTools "Write,Edit,MultiEdit,NotebookEdit,Bash,Task,WebFetch,WebSearch" \
  --restricted --add-dir <dirname(sessionFilePath)> \
  --no-session-persistence --setting-sources "" \
  --output-format stream-json --include-partial-messages --verbose
```

Reads are fenced as well as writes (decided 2026-09-16): `--restricted` makes
the file tools refuse any path outside cwd and `--add-dir`, as a tool error
rather than a permission rule, and the only added directory is the
transcript's (`~/.claude/projects/<project>/`, which also holds the session's
subagent transcripts and the project's other sessions — `--add-dir` has no
per-file form). With no known project the transcript directory is the cwd, so
the fence holds there too; home as cwd would have fenced nothing. Verified by
a forced out-of-scope Read and Grep on CLI 2.1.273, cold and pre-spawned.
`--restricted` is present from CLI 2.1.267 at least; an older CLI fails the
ask with a readable error, never the wrapped agent.

(WebFetch removed from the M0-era flag set and mutating tools hard-blocked —
decided 2026-08-24: --allowedTools alone only auto-denies, while
--disallowedTools removes the tools structurally; WebFetch would allow
prompt-injection exfiltration of transcript text.)

Stdout is jsonl; answer text = `stream_event` lines with
`content_block_delta`/`text_delta` (ignore `system`, hook, and snapshot
lines — `-p` runs the user's hooks, which is accepted noise; `--bare` would
skip them but breaks OAuth auth).

- Composed prompt template (keep in one file, `responders/prompt.ts`):
  system-style preamble ("You are answering a reader's question about a
  coding-agent session. The full transcript is at <sessionFilePath> — read the
  relevant parts with your tools. The project lives at <projectDir>. Be
  grounded: cite what in the transcript or files supports your answer. Answer
  concisely.") + prior side-chat turns + `ANCHOR (user-selected text): ...` +
  `QUESTION: ...`.
- **Pointer, not payload**: do NOT inline the whole transcript. The engine
  reads the jsonl itself via Read/Grep. (Fallback for engines without tools:
  inline the anchor's surrounding ±30 messages, truncated to ~30k chars.)
- Billing rides the user's existing Claude subscription/login — that is the
  point of this design (target users are subscribers without API keys).
- M0 verified: works concurrently with an interactive `claude` session;
  `--allowedTools` blocks writes (file not created); latency seconds-scale
  (~8s trivial, ~24s transcript-reading question).

### codex-cli responder **[SHIPPED 2026-08-27 — verified on codex-cli 0.150.1]**

```
codex exec --model <codexResponderModel> \
  --config 'model_reasoning_effort="<codexResponderEffort>"' \
  --sandbox read-only --ephemeral --json --skip-git-repo-check "<composed prompt>"
```

Same prompt template, spawned with stdin IGNORED (a piped stdin makes
`codex exec` wait for EOF to append it to the prompt). `--ephemeral` is the
`--no-session-persistence` analog — without it each ask writes a rollout
into `~/.codex/sessions`. `--json` has no token deltas: completed
`agent_message` items are the answer (item-sized chunks); `item.started`
command executions feed the progress line. `responderModel`/
`responderEffort` remain claude-cli settings. Codex uses the separate
`codexResponderModel`/`codexResponderEffort` settings, defaulting to
`gpt-5.6-terra`/`medium`; both are supplied explicitly so the viewed Codex
session's defaults cannot affect Ask. Updated 2026-09-08.

### Compressed Codex Ask (2026-09-13)

Only Codex answers Codex sessions. For `.jsonl.zst`, its prompt directs the
existing read-only sandbox to the bundled Node `readCodexRollout.js` helper,
using the same installed optional decoder. The helper streams decoded JSONL
to stdout with backpressure; it creates no decompressed file and does not
resume/restore an agent session. Pipelines must use pipefail; decoder errors
make partial output unavailable as complete evidence. Ask awaits source
reconciliation and refuses known source errors before persisting a question.
Plain Codex prompts and Claude's Read/Grep/Glob cage remain unchanged.
No normalized full-session projection is needed under strict routing.

### Engine config

- Claude: optional `"responderModel"` and `"responderEffort"`; its CLI
  defaults apply when unset.
- Codex: optional `"codexResponderModel"` and `"codexResponderEffort"`;
  Sight defaults to `gpt-5.6-terra` and `medium`. The panel shows the
  effective values and saves changes before enabling the next Ask.
- Settings are read per Ask — no daemon restart is needed.
- No engine pin. Routing is the session's adapter, full stop (decided
  2026-09-13); a `responder` key in an older config is ignored.
- A BYOK api engine (direct Messages API, no tools, inline excerpt as its
  grounding) existed through 2026-08-31 and was cut: it never ran (requires
  both CLIs absent plus a hand-configured key — contradicting "a session on
  disk implies its CLI is installed"), and its tool-less grounding forced
  every grounding improvement to be built twice. Decided 2026-08-31;
  the Responder interface is the seam to rebuild it against if a real user
  needs one.

### Read-only enforcement summary (product promise B5)

| Engine | Mechanism |
|---|---|
| claude-cli | `--allowedTools "Read,Grep,Glob"` + `--disallowedTools` on all mutating/exfiltrating tools; `--restricted --add-dir <transcript dir>` fences reads to the project and the transcript directory |
| codex-cli | `--sandbox read-only` — blocks writes and network (verified 2026-09-16: DNS fails inside the sandbox), not reads; Codex has no read fence, so its responder can read any file the user can |
| codebuddy-cli | `--tools` / `--allowedTools "Read,Grep,Glob"` + `--disallowedTools` including CBC-only mutators (`PowerShell`, `Agent`, `REPL`, `Skill`); `--setting-sources none` (empty string loads all sources); `--add-dir <transcript dir>` is a grant, not a fence. No `--restricted` — out-of-trusted-dir reads are a permission deny, not a structural file-tool error (same class of residual as Codex `--sandbox read-only`). Flags read from `--help` / the installed package on cbc 2.150.0; not live-fired against a model |

If an engine cannot guarantee read-only, it must not be offered as a
candidate.

## 7. HTTP API (daemon, port 2020 default, `SIGHT_PORT` to override; bind 127.0.0.1 only)

```
GET  /api/sessions?project=&q=            → SessionMeta[]
GET  /api/sessions/:id                    → SessionMeta + events (paginated: ?before_seq=&limit=200)
GET  /api/sessions/:id/stream             → SSE: new NormalizedEvents as they ingest
GET  /api/search?q=                       → [{ sessionId, sessionTitle, messageId, snippet }]  (match ranges U+0001…U+0002-delimited, no HTML — decided 2026-08-24 M4)
GET  /api/side-chats?sessionId=           → SideChat[] (for margin markers)
POST /api/side-chats                      → create { sessionId, anchorMessageId, anchorText }
POST /api/side-chats/:id/ask              → body { question }; response = SSE stream of chunks; persists turn on completion
POST /api/side-chats/:id/cancel
DELETE /api/side-chats/:id
POST /api/stats/:event                    → increment (viewer_open | question_asked)
GET  /api/responder/status                → { engine, options, responderModel, responderEffort } (effective engine values)
PUT  /api/responder/config                → { engine, responderModel?, responderEffort? } → engine-specific keys in ~/.sight/config.json
GET  /api/health
```

Serve `web/dist` statically at `/`. SPA routes: `/` (session list),
`/s/:sessionId` (viewer, `?m=<messageId>` scroll target).

### Liveness derivation (signals × rules × outcomes)

The `live` / `waiting` / `busySince` / `quietSince` fields on API session rows are never
stored — they are derived per response across four layers (each rule decided
separately, settled between 2026-08-24 and 2026-09-01; this table is the whole
machine in one place). Fail-open at every layer: `liveSessions()` returns an
empty map on any error, and an empty map makes `withLive` pass rows through
undecorated — dots grey out, nothing breaks.

| # | Layer | Signal | Rule | Outcome |
|---|-------|--------|------|---------|
| 1a | claude-code adapter `liveSessions()` | `~/.claude/sessions/<pid>.json`: `status`, `pid`, `procStart`, `statusUpdatedAt` | file says busy/waiting AND the pid exists in one `ps` batch AND its start time matches `procStart` (recycled-pid guard). `ps` unusable → degrade to a bare pid-alive check (a recycled pid is cosmetic; a blacked-out running dot is the M5 bug) | live-map entry `busy` or `waiting`, `since = statusUpdatedAt` (0 if absent) |
| 1b | codex adapter `liveSessions()` | flock on `~/.codex/thread-writer-locks/<uuid>.lock`, probed via one `lsof` batch | lock held ⇒ process exists; codex has no busy/idle vocabulary — layers 2–3 decide what it's doing | live-map entry `alive`, `since = 0` |
| 2 | codex `parseLine` → store `turn_open` / `turn_started_at` | `event_msg` `task_*` lines (patch-only carriers, no display row) | `task_started` opens the turn; **any other** `task_*` subtype — including unobserved future ones — closes it (a stuck-open turn pins the busy dot; a wrongly-closed one just greys until the next `task_started`) | `turnOpen` + `turnStartedAt` on the session row. claude-code writes no turn markers → `turnOpen` stays `null` |
| 3a | server `withLive` — subagent rows (`parentId` set) | parent's live-map entry, own `endedAt` + `updatedAt` | a subagent has no process of its own: it runs while its parent does, its end isn't recorded in the parent transcript, and it moved within `STALE_BUSY_MS` (a run killed with no task-notification must not read busy for hours) | `live: true, waiting: false`, else row unchanged |
| 3b | server `withLive` | no live-map entry for the session | process gone or signal unavailable | row unchanged (not live) |
| 3c | server `withLive` | `alive` AND `turnOpen === false` | process exists but the transcript says the turn ended — an open TUI sitting idle | row unchanged, grey immediately (`turnOpen: null` falls through to 3e instead) |
| 3d | server `withLive` | `waiting` from the live map, or `alive` AND the stored tail parked on an unresultted blocking `tool_use` (`pendingBlockId` × `dialect.isBlockingUse`) | agents with a waiting vocabulary (claude) report it themselves; codex flushes pending calls, so its transcript can say so | `waiting: true` — and exempt from 3e: parked on the user is legitimately open-ended, and "waiting for you" is the signal the indicator exists to deliver |
| 3e | server `withLive` — staleness backstop | `now − max(busySince, updatedAt) > STALE_BUSY_MS` (15 min) and not waiting | a `busy`/`alive` claim must be corroborated by something still moving — the CLI writes `status: busy` once at turn start and never refreshes it. Margin calibrated on claude's write batching (longest measured in-turn silence ~5.5 min) | `quietSince = max(busySince, updatedAt)`, not live: the process is verified alive (it is in the map) but nothing moves — rendered *unverifiable* with the silence length, never busy (forever-green) and never plain idle (silence is not evidence the turn ended; decided 2026-09-02) |
| 3f | server `withLive` | everything above passed | | `live: true, waiting, busySince` = `turnStartedAt` (alive) or the live-map `since` (busy/waiting) |
| 4a | web `status.ts` `sessionStatus` | API `waiting` / `live`, `updatedAt`, per-browser `seen` stamps | `waiting` → **waiting**; `live` → **busy**; `quietSince` → **unverifiable** (dashed ring, "no update in 34m · process still alive"); updated < 10 min ago AND newer than `seen` → **done**; else **idle**. Deliberately no freshness→busy fallback: reaching the fallback means the probe said not-running and the user saw the tail, so "running" would lie in the common just-watched-it-finish case | one display status for list + switcher, ranked waiting > done > busy > unverifiable = idle (actionability; unverifiable ties with idle so it sorts by recency — a week-old abandoned process must not float above today's sessions — but stays in the switcher, which drops only idle) |
| 4b | web `SessionView` `running` | `session.live` OR last real message row < 60 s old (`RUNNING_MS`; meta rows like `away_summary` excluded so they can't re-light the dot) | in-view freshness heuristic covers agents/versions with no live signal; long model turns write nothing, so `live` ORs in | trailing tool fold stays expanded (live-follow); view-header dot |

## 8. CLI behaviors (fail-open details)

`sight claude [args...]`:
1. Best-effort (wrap in try/catch, 1s timeout budget total): ensure daemon —
   check pidfile + `/api/health`; if down — or up but started before
   `dist/daemon/main.js` was last written (`/api/health.startedAt`), in which
   case SIGTERM it first — spawn detached
   (`child_process.spawn(node daemonEntry, { detached: true, stdio: 'ignore' })`).
2. Best-effort: print `sight: http://127.0.0.1:2020` (stderr, TTY only) and
   open the browser **only if no viewer is open right now**. `/api/health`
   reports open SSE streams (exact) and the time of the last viewer request
   (the list page polls every 10s; hidden tabs get their timers aligned to
   1 min, so a request within 90s counts). `open` (macOS) / `xdg-open`.
   If the probes answer and the daemon is not there (port taken, crashed),
   print one line pointing at `daemon.log` and `SIGHT_PORT`; a timed-out
   probe (slow cold start) prints nothing. A foreign `/api/health` on the
   port is not ours unless it carries `startedAt`.
3. Always: `spawn('claude', args, { stdio: 'inherit' })`; forward SIGINT/SIGTERM;
   `process.exit(childCode)`.
Steps 1–2 failing must not delay step 3 by more than ~1s and must never abort it.

Daemon lifecycle: pidfile `~/.sight/daemon.pid`; `sight stop` sends
SIGTERM; stale pidfiles are detected via `/api/health` probe.

## 9. Frontend structure (guidance, not pixel spec)

### Per-agent presentation: dialects (src/shared/dialects/)

The adapter parses transcripts into RenderBlocks; how an agent's tools
*present* — which tool_use is a question card or a plan, how file edits
diff, what counts as CLI plumbing, the input-queue strip — is per-agent
presentation policy. That lives in a `Dialect`: pure
`RenderBlock/StoredEvent → data` functions (no React, no node APIs — the
directory is daemon-importable on purpose), dispatched by
`dialectFor(session.adapter)` with a generic fallback whose every method
returns null/false/[] — an agent without a dialect renders at the defensive
floor (plain folds, no cards). Deliberately NOT adapter-side semantic
normalization: presentation semantics churn fast and stored semantics would
tax every iteration with a re-ingest; promote a semantic into shared types
only once it recurs in ≥2 agents with the same shape (decided
2026-08-27).

- Layout: left = content (list or transcript), right = collapsible side-chat
  panel. Global header: app name, reading controls, and — on the list page —
  the search box and project filter; on a session page the search box gives way
  to the "Sessions · N" switcher popover (SPEC §5.6).
- Transcript message rendering per RenderBlock type; tool_use/tool_result and
  thinking are `<details>`-style collapsed rows; `unknown`/`raw` are collapsed
  JSON `<pre>`.
- Selection → Ask button: on `mouseup` inside the transcript container, if
  `window.getSelection()` is non-empty and within one message element, show
  the floating button anchored to the selection rect. Record
  `anchorMessageId` = that message's id.
- Margin marker: absolute-positioned dot in the message gutter when
  `/api/side-chats` reports anchors for that message.
- Keep state simple: React Query or plain fetch+useState; no Redux.
- Theme: four dark palettes borrowed from terminal themes (Gruvbox Dark Hard
  default, Catppuccin Mocha, Tokyo Night, Dracula) plus one light, picked in
  the Aa popover. Dark by default because the reader sits next to a dark
  terminal, and the palette's job is to make that hop painless.

## 10. Error handling & logging

- Daemon log: `~/.sight/daemon.log` (append, size-capped rotate at 5MB).
- Parse warnings logged once per file per schema-surprise (no log spam per line).
- Responder failures surface in the side panel as a readable error with the
  engine name and a retry button — never a silent empty answer.

## 11. Security notes

- Bind 127.0.0.1 only. No auth in v1 (localhost, single user) — acceptable and
  documented.
- Sanitize all rendered markdown/HTML (transcripts contain untrusted text from
  webpages/tools). No `dangerouslySetInnerHTML` on unsanitized content.
- Responder prompts include transcript content — that content is untrusted;
  the read-only tool cage (B5) is the mitigation for prompt-injection attempts
  from transcript text. Never widen the toolset.
